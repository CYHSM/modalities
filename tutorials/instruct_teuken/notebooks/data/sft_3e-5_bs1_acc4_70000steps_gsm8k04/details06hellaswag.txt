Relationships: How to ditch insincere friends. Identify the friends who bring negativity to your life. If you have friends who eye roll or whisper behind your back, you may want to put them on the " naughty " list. Personalities to watch out for include : Judgmental: this friend tries to make you think that he knows better than you and/or attempts to correct you at every turn. Manipulative: he doesn't have your best interest at heart, but rather his own. This friend will dig into your weak spots and use them against you for his gain.

Health: How to clean a bowl or chillum. Remove any debris or resin from the bowl. Use a toothpick or similar implement, such as a paperclip. Tap the debris out after each pass.

Transitioning to a semi-vegetarian diet is an excellent way to lose or manage your weight.

Work World: How to teach without a teaching degree. Teach at a private school if you have another type of degree. Look for postings for jobs at private schools and online through the websites of organizations like the national association of independent schools (nais). In many cases you don't need a degree in education. Instead, a bachelor's degree or higher in a subject area (like english, biology, or italian) can be enough. Job postings will generally be tied to the school calendar.

Health: How to identify gallbladder disease. Learn about gallstones. When gallbladder digestive fluid hardens into deposits, it can create gallstones. These deposits can range in size from the size of a grain of sand to a large golf ball.  Watch for signs of jaundice.

Shaving: A man sits in a chair while a standing man uses an electric razor on his beard. The man gently shaves the other man's beard until it is gone.

Home and Garden: How to make a standing desk. Measure yourself. The perfect standing workspace is one that's specifically suited for you. Before you attempt to construct your own desk or go on the hunt for another option, it will help to estimate a few basic body measurements. Make a note of your overall height, the level of your eyeline and the distance between your hips, elbows and the floor. These rough measurements will come in handy later while working out the specifications for the standing desk that fits your build.

This is especially important if you know you will be drinking for a sustained period, like a bar crawl.

Computers and Electronics: How to write imagery poems. Brainstorm a subject for your poem. Finding a subject (or list of subjects) that you want to write about can be daunting. While it can be tempting to use some grand poetic theme, such as love, something small and specific is typically easier to work with.  Go out in public and immerse yourself in your surroundings-no headphones or texting your friends. Get a notebook and a pen, sit somewhere, and observe the world around you.

Food and Entertaining: How to enjoy the taste of beer. Drink different kinds of beer. When most people believe they don't like beer, it's because they've only had the bad stuff. Be sure to give other types a beer a chance, from high-end artisanal microbrews to more common brands like coors and budweiser. As with anything else, it may be that there's another sort of beer out there that you'd like better. Don't be afraid to try out beers that you've never had before.

Health: How to remove bad breath. Brush your teeth for 2 minutes twice a day. This is the number one thing you can do to fight bad breath. Using a toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste, brush in the morning and evening every day. Set a timer for two minutes or listen to a short song to keep time, since most people do not brush for long enough. If you are really worried about bad breath, brush after every meal.

Work World: How to become a funeral director. Look into informal training. Depending on your state's requirements, a formal education may not be necessary. Many funeral directors in the united states were born into the trade, or gained entry via a local business early on. If a local funeral home is willing to provide you training, informal training may be enough to eventually obtain an apprenticeship and a license. Keep in mind, most funeral homes will only provide training to those with formal education.

Health: How to get started. Unload your mind. Write down a to-do list of all the things you have promised to accomplish in addition to this project. Get the tasks out of your head and onto a piece of paper to free up some mental space for your new project.  Keep a personal and professional list, so that you can keep work tasks at the office and avoid wasting time at work. Schedule a time to accomplish each thing on your calendar.

Computers and Electronics: How to get a high score on subway surfers. Build up your multiplier. The best way to get a higher score quicker is to improve your multiplier. When you first begin playing, your multiplier will be set at x1. Every time you beat a set of missions, you will level up, and your multiplier will permanently increase by one, up to x30. This means that your score will be 30 times what it would normally be if you have a full multiplier.

Home and Garden: How to reduce, reuse, and recycle. Buy products with less packaging. Avoid single-serve or individually wrapped items. Shop at stores that have bulk dispensers for grains, nuts, dried fruits, and snacks. Bring your own plastic bag or container to put the bulk food in.

Vacuuming the back with the beater bar/rotating brush helps push dirt trapped deep down toward the top of the rug. Flip it right side up and vacuum the dirt. Use only suction on the front of wool rugs, for synthetic rugs you can use the beater bar/rotating brush on the front and back.

Home and Garden: How to clean rat droppings. Ventilate the space where you will clean. Open the doors and windows of the area where you need to clean the droppings.

Consider wearing an eye mask when cleaning after large infestations of rats.

Cars & Other Vehicles: How to inflate a car tire with a bike pump. Park on a clear, flat surface. A clear parking area will allow you to freely move around your car to fill up tires without anything getting in the way. Parking on a level surface will make it easier for you to balance and operate your pump.  If you don't have a suitable clear, flat surface at home, you might park in the street or a neighbor's driveway. Driving on tires that are flat can damage your tire or deform the rims of your wheels, causing expensive damage.

Holidays and Traditions: How to make whipped topping. Chill your tools and ingredients. Place a large glass or metal bowl in the refrigerator about an hour before making your whipped cream. Refrigerate a pair of metal beaters from a hand mixer as well. Keep your cream refrigerated right up until the moment you plan to make your whipped cream. Chilling the equipment before making the whipped cream will make it easier to incorporate air into the cream.

Computers and Electronics: How to encourage kids to exercise if they dislike sports. Consider alternative sports. Just because sports like football, baseball, hockey, or soccer are widely popular doesn't mean that all kids will enjoy them. When thinking of exercise routines for your kids, think outside of the box. Things like dance, martial arts, boxing, gymnastics, swimming, biking, skateboarding, surfing, and skiing are all sports that they can enjoy. Other alternative sports include circus arts, dirt biking, fencing, rock climbing, and rugby.

Cars & Other Vehicles: How to maintain total focus while driving a school bus. Be on time to the bus. That's easier said than done, especially if you're subbing for someone, but being late throws you off balance. It flusters you. When you're running around like a chicken with its head cut off, you're not thinking clearly and not totally focused. Many, many school bus accidents happen in the school parking lot.

Futsal: A large group of people are seen standing around a gymnasium that leads into several clips of people throwing balls to one another. More clips are shown of people kicking balls into goals and others blocking them. The players continue practicing drills with one another and ends with text going up the screen.

Removing curlers: A woman in black has her hair rolled in curlers. The woman unroll the curlers and put it down.

Futsal: Other teams plays soccer, a player with white uniform receives a ball and score. Two teams play soccer, and the player with the yellow uniform scores. Two team of girls compete, a girl with red uniform scores and the team wins.

Home and Garden: How to open locked cars. Straighten a wire hanger. This method will work best for vehicles with a vertical manual lock-meaning a lock that you pull up to unlock or push down to lock. These locks are usually at the top of the door panel just inside the window. This method requires a thin but rigid tool that you can feed between the weatherstripping around the bottom of the window and the glass itself. A wire coat hanger works well, but you must straighten it first.

Work World: How to clean garden gloves. Rinse your gloves after use. Right after you use your gloves to garden, there may be loose dirt and debris on the material. It's best to rinse them right away, so excess soil and other materials don't have a chance to sit on the fabric for too long. You can use a garden hose or the kitchen sink to rinse them. It's often easier to rinse the gloves if you leave them on your hands.
